# GIMO Token

\$GIMO – The Core Utility and Governance Token of the GIMO Ecosystem

The foundation of the GIMO Finance ecosystem is the **\$GIMO token** — a multifunctional asset that serves as both a governance and reward mechanism. Designed to align user participation with protocol growth, \$GIMO empowers the community while fostering long-term platform sustainability.

Key functions of the $GIMO token include:

- **Governance Rights**
    
    $GIMO holders can influence the strategic direction of GIMO Finance by participating in governance proposals and protocol decision-making processes.
    
- **0G Governance Participation**
    
    Through accumulated st0G holdings, $GIMO enables users to exercise governance rights within the broader 0G ecosystem.
    
- **Incentivized Engagement**
    
    Users who lock $GIMO tokens are eligible for participation rewards, encouraging sustained involvement and activity across the platform.
    
- **Buyback and Burn Mechanism**
    
    A portion of platform revenues — including staking reward fees and other profits — is allocated for periodic $GIMO buybacks and token burns, supporting a deflationary token model.
    
- **External Voting Incentives**
    
    GIMO Finance partners may offer rewards or benefits to token holders in exchange for their participation in governance voting initiatives.
    

$GIMO is more than a token — it’s the cornerstone of community-driven innovation and governance within the GIMO ecosystem.

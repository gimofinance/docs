# Gimo Finance

> Gimo Finance is the leading liquid staking protocol for the 0G Network, the first decentralized AI operating system, powered by StaFi’s AI LSaaS.

## The Inspiration Behind Gimo Finance

Gimo is inspired by a Scottish Fold cat from Korea, famous for its sleek black fur and crystal-clear, expressive eyes. Its adorable appearance quickly captured widespread affection.

The name "Gimo" is easy and light to pronounce, evoking a sense of modernity, agility, and technological innovation. It mirrors Gimo Finance’s foundation built on StaFi’s AI LSaaS architecture, underscoring its commitment to innovation and technological advancement.

Moreover, the sound of "Gimo" carries a playful, onomatopoeic quality—reminiscent of soft sounds like "goo goo" or "meow"—which naturally conveys a friendly, approachable, and youthful spirit. This perfectly reflects the vision of the Gimo community: encouraging open participation, fostering collective growth, and building a vibrant, evolving ecosystem together.

## Gimo Finance: Unlock the Full Potential of $0G Token

0G is the first decentralized Artificial Intelligence Layer (AIL)—a modular, infinitely scalable Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically to support onchain AI at scale. Its architecture is built to handle the data, performance, and interoperability demands of next-generation AI applications.

Gimo Finance, powered by the StaFi LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service), is a key infrastructure protocol within the 0G ecosystem. It enables 0G token holders to unlock sustainable yield through non-custodial liquid staking.

By staking through Gimo Finance, users receive **st0G**, a liquid, interest-bearing token that represents their staked A0GI. st0G not only accrues staking rewards, but also maintains full liquidity and composability across the 0G DeFi ecosystem.

This integration allows A0GI holders to both secure the network and participate in DeFi opportunities simultaneously—amplifying capital efficiency and supporting the broader growth of 0G's AI-powered infrastructure.

## Ecosystem Benefits

- **Strengthening Network Security:** Gimo Finance introduces a non-custodial staking model that allows A0GI token holders to directly contribute to network consensus and security. By decentralizing validator support, Gimo helps reduce reliance on a few large stakeholders, making the 0G network more resilient and censorship-resistant.
- **Boosting Capital Efficiency:** Through Gimo, users receive **st0G**—a fully liquid, yield-generating derivative of staked A0GI tokens. This means users don’t need to choose between earning rewards and maintaining liquidity. st0G can be held, traded, or utilized in DeFi protocols while still accruing staking yields, turning idle assets into productive ones.
- **Expanding DeFi Utility Across the 0G Ecosystem:** st0G is not just a staking receipt—it’s a powerful DeFi primitive. It can be seamlessly integrated into lending markets, yield farms, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity pools within the 0G ecosystem. This creates a composable financial layer where users can stack multiple strategies for higher capital efficiency.
- **Increasing Community Engagement and Participation:** By streamlining the staking experience and reducing technical barriers, Gimo makes it easy for all types of users—novices and veterans alike—to engage in 0G staking. This encourages wider token distribution, strengthens community alignment, and drives more active participation in ecosystem governance and development.
- **Enhancing Liquidity Infrastructure:** st0G acts as a native liquidity layer within the 0G ecosystem. As adoption grows, it enables the formation of new liquidity pools, cross-protocol integrations, and efficient capital flows across the network. This supports more dynamic on-chain markets and fosters a sustainable, self-reinforcing economic loop.
- **Supporting 0G's Modular AI Infrastructure:** Gimo’s integration with StaFi’s LSaaS stack aligns perfectly with 0G’s modular and scalable architecture. It supports AI-driven applications by offering a reliable, incentive-aligned staking layer, ensuring the network remains secure while enabling the next generation of on-chain AI innovations.

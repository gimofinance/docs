# AI-Powered LSaaS

## About StaFi Protocol

[StaFi](https://www.stafi.io/) is a leading liquid staking infrastructure provider dedicated to unlocking the liquidity of staked assets on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains. Through its AI-powered LSaaS framework, StaFi enables the permissionless creation of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs) across a wide range of ecosystems, including:

- Ethereum (ETH)
- EVM-compatible chains
- Bitcoin (via Layer 2)
- Cosmos
- TON
- Solana

In addition to its LSaaS framework, StaFi operates as a standalone liquid staking protocol supporting major ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos, and BNB Chain. It issues [rTokens](https://app.stafi.io/gallery/all/) (e.g., rETH, rSOL, rMATIC, rATOM) that represent staked assets while preserving full liquidity and composability across DeFi. By bridging the gap between staking security and liquidity access, StaFi delivers a scalable solution for both users and protocols across the PoS landscape.

## About StaFi AI-Powered LSaaS

[StaFi AI-Powered LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service)](https://www.stafi.io/lsaas/) is an intelligent staking infrastructure framework that enables developers to deploy Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs) efficiently across multiple blockchain environments. Inspired by the Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) paradigm, LSaaS abstracts the complexities of protocol design into a modular, developer-centric stack.

The Stack is divided into two parts:

- **Standard Stack:** Includes essential functions such as staking, unstaking, and reward updates.
- **Modular:** Provides advanced features beyond the basics, including interoperability and DeFi integration, requiring further development.

## LSaaS Architecture

StaFi’s LSaaS framework is designed with modularity, scalability, and upgradability at its core. It abstracts away the complexity of liquid staking mechanics while offering a flexible toolkit for protocol developers. Whether building standard LSTs or more advanced LRTs, LSaaS provides a structured pathway from core staking logic to full DeFi composability.

At the foundation, the Standard Stack delivers essential features such as staking/unstaking mechanisms and real-time reward accrual and distribution. On top of this base layer, StaFi introduces Modular Extensions that unlock advanced capabilities, including cross-chain interoperability, native DeFi integrations, and support for AI- and ZK-enabled staking logic.

This layered architecture enables protocol builders to launch tailored staking applications, adapting to the needs of specific chains and communities.

### **Component Stacks Overview**

To serve different ecosystems and use cases, StaFi provides pre-configured component stacks:

- **ETH LST Stack:** Powers liquid staking for native ETH, integrating seamlessly with Ethereum’s beacon chain and existing validator infrastructure.
- **EVM LST Stack:** Supports EVM-compatible chains like BNB Chain and Polygon, allowing rapid deployment of LSTs using shared tooling and smart contract standards.
- **EigenLayer LRT Stack:** Enables liquid restaking on EigenLayer, allowing users to secure additional networks while maximizing capital efficiency through dual staking.
- **Babylon LST Stack:** Built for Babylon’s Bitcoin security-sharing model, enabling staking derivatives tied to BTC-pegged validator sets.
- **Karak LRT Stack:** Designed to integrate with Karak’s modular restaking architecture, supporting dynamic delegation and layered validator networks.
- **Cosmos LST Stack:** Tailored for Cosmos SDK chains with IBC support, offering cross-chain liquid staking across sovereign PoS zones.
- **Solana LST Stack:** Engineered for Solana’s high-throughput network, optimizing for parallelized execution and fast finality in LST issuance.
- **TON LST Stack:** Enables liquid staking within The Open Network (TON), bridging staking rewards with applications native to the Telegram ecosystem.
- **StaFi AI Agent:** An intelligent automation layer that streamlines validator orchestration, deployment workflows, and staking logic customization.

### Modular App Store

StaFi LSaaS features a growing library of plug-and-play modules that extend staking functionality across multiple dimensions:

- **Point Module:** Introduces gamified staking missions and point-based rewards to drive engagement.
- **CCIP Module:** Enables secure cross-chain messaging using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.
- **ZK Module:** Integrates zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving staking and trustless validation.
- **AI Module:** Powers automated code generation, validator optimization, and AI-driven staking logic.
- **Everclear Module:** Supports on-chain intent resolution and transaction coordination for seamless execution.
- **Blink Module:** Improves staking responsiveness through real-time finality and rapid unbonding capabilities.

Collectively, these modules allow developers to rapidly compose tailored staking protocols while maintaining security, interoperability, and UX consistency.

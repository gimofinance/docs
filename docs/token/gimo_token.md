# $GIMO Token

$GIMO – Core Utility and Governance Layer of the GIMO Ecosystem

At the heart of GIMO Finance lies the \$GIMO token — a multi-functional asset designed to align community participation with protocol growth. Serving both as a governance tool and reward mechanism, \$GIMO empowers stakeholders while supporting the long-term sustainability of the platform.

- **Protocol Governance:** \$GIMO holders can propose and vote on protocol-level decisions, helping steer the strategic direction of Gimo Finance through on-chain governance.
- **0G Ecosystem Voting Rights:** By accumulating \$st0G, users gain the ability to influence decision-making within the broader 0G governance system, with \$GIMO acting as the permissioned access layer for such participation.
- **Incentivized Participation:** Users who lock \$GIMO are eligible for protocol rewards, incentivizing long-term alignment and deeper community engagement across the ecosystem.
- **Buyback & Burn Mechanics:** A share of protocol revenue, including staking commissions and ecosystem fees, is allocated to the periodic buyback and burn of \$GIMO. This mechanism reduces token supply over time, reinforcing its deflationary design.
- **External Voting Utility:** Partner projects may integrate \$GIMO as a governance signal, offering rewards or utility incentives to \$GIMO holders who participate in relevant proposal votes.

$GIMO is more than a utility token, it anchors governance, incentives, and ecosystem value flow within GIMO Finance’s AI-native liquidity architecture. Tokenomics, distribution models, and emission schedules will be released in the near future to provide full transparency and alignment with long-term ecosystem goals.
